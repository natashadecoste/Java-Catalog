# Java-Catalog

This is the README.md for the Java Catalog Project

**************************************

This project implements OOP in order to create classes for each type of item that can be catalogued. For our purposes there are Readables (containing subclasses Books and EBooks) and then Audibles (containing subclasses AudioBooks and MP3s). The program reads in line by line from 4 seperate .txt files named by their explicit type (Books.txt, Audiobooks.txt, MP3s.txt, EBooks.txt) and allows the user to interact with the UserInterface (main class)and select items and add to shopping cart and then purchase. It then tracks the orders, and rewrites the data back into the txt files. There is a login that also lets the user create a new login. 
***************************************

To Run

via CMD
$ javac UserInterface.java
$ java UserInterface
